# Plagarism-Checker-Using-Machine-Learning
Developed a machine learningâ€“based plagiarism detection system capable of identifying copied or AI-generated text with high accuracy. The project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and cosine similarity to analyze text similarity between documents. Additionally, the system integrates machine learning models to classify text as original, plagiarized, or AI-generated.

The solution also includes:

Web Interface (Flask/Streamlit): User-friendly application to upload text/documents and view results.

Visualization: Circular percentage graphs showing plagiarism score, highlighted plagiarized sections, and matched sources.

Web Search Integration: Detects online sources of copied content via Google Custom Search API.

Advanced Features: Outlier detection, similarity threshold tuning, and AI-content detection.

This project demonstrates skills in Python, NLP, machine learning, Streamlit, and data visualization, with applications in academia, publishing, and content verification.
